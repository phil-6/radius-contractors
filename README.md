# Radius Contractors

## Find builders and tradespeople recommend by people you trust.

It's really challenging to find reliable builders. Check-a-trade and MyBuilder are commercial behemoths, focused on their bottom line rather than providing a good service to homeowners.

Radius contractors takes a different approach, the builders you can see on here are only those that have been reviewed by people you have connected with.

It was inspired by our group of friends who did this using a Google Doc!
