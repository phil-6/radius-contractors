# Radius Contractors

## Find builders and tradespeople recommended by people you trust.

It's really challenging to find reliable builders. Check-a-trade and MyBuilder are commercial behemoths, focused on their bottom line rather than providing a good service to homeowners.

Radius contractors takes a different approach, the builders you can see on here are only those that have been reviewed by people you have connected with.

It was inspired by our group of friends who did this using a Google Doc!



If you're a user who wants to share builders with their friends then sign up below.

If you're a builder, do good work and get recommended. If you have any issues then you can reach out here

## Getting Started (as an end user)

For this app to be useful, you need to sign up with at least one other friend, so you can both see each other's recommended builders.

You can sign up from the link below, then you can generate a personalised link invite your friends.

Once you've signed up, you can add builders you've used, the jobs they've worked or quoted for and give them a rating. When you friends sign up and do the same thing, you'll be able to see the builders they have used and rated.

It requires a bit of community effort, but it's that simple!
