    <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
    <p>Radius Contractors is a <strong>community-driven platform</strong> for finding reliable buildersâ€”no ads, no tracking, and
      <a href="https://github.com/phil-6/radius-contractors">open source</a>.</p>
    <p>Think of it like <strong>asking a friend for a recommendation</strong>, but on a larger scale.</p>
    <p>ðŸš€ It's free and costs about Â£15/month to run. If you'd like to support it,
