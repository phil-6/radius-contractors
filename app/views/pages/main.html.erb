    It's really challenging to find reliable builders.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Check-a-trade and MyBuilder are commercial behemoths, focused on their bottom line
    rather than providing a good service to homeowners.
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    We take a different approach, the builders you can see here are only those that have been reviewed by people you
    have connected with.

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>For this app to be useful, you need to sign up with at least one other friend, so you can both see each other's recommended
      builders.</p>
    <p>You can sign up from the link below, then you can generate a personalised link invite your friends.</p>
    <p>Once you've signed up, you can add builders you've used, the jobs they've worked or quoted for and give them a rating. When you
      friends sign up and do the same thing, you'll be able to see the builders they have rated.</p>
    <p>It requires a bit of community effort, but it's that simple!</p>
    <p>If you're a builder, do good work and get recommended! If you have any issues then you can reach out
      <a href="mailto:contractors@purpleriver.dev">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>What's this all about?</h3>
    <p>Radius Contractors is a community-driven platform for finding reliable builders.</p>
    <p>Instead of being able to see reviews from anyone, you can only see reviews from people you know. This means that you can trust
      the reviews you see, as they're from people you trust.</p>
    <p>It's a bit like asking your friends for a recommendation, but on a larger scale.</p>
    <p>It's free to use, <a href="https://github.com/phil-6/radius-contractors">open source</a>, with no advertising and limited tracking
      and will stay that way for as long as it can.</p>
    <p>The current costs are around £15 per month, if you want to contribute to the running you can buy me a coffee.</p>
